# Leetcode 347. Top K Frequent Elements

use **Counter** to count the frequency of each element in the list ðŸš€

- **solution 1**: use **sorted()** to sort the elements by their frequency in descending order.
- **solution 2**: use **bucket sort** to sort the elements by their frequency in descending order. (efficient!)

## Time and Space Complexity

### solution 1: topKFrequent()

```
TC: O(n log n)
SC: O(n)
```

#### TC is O(n log n):
- iterating through the list just once to count the frequency of each element. = O(n)
- sorting the elements by their frequency in descending order. = O(n log n)

#### SC is O(n):
- using a Counter to store the frequency of each element. = O(n)
- sorted() creates a new list that holds the elements of frequency_map. = O(n)
- result list that holds the top k frequent elements. = O(k)

### solution 2: topKFrequentBucketSort()

```
TC: O(n)
SC: O(n)
```

#### TC is O(n):
- iterating through the list just once to count the frequency of each element. = O(n)
- creating **buckets** to store the elements by their frequency. = O(n)
- iterating through the buckets in reverse order to get only the top k frequent elements. = O(n)

#### SC is O(n):
- using a Counter to store the frequency of each element. = O(n)
- using buckets to store the elements by their frequency. = O(n)
- result list that holds only the top k frequent elements. = O(k)
